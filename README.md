# foilVis
**openGL airfoil visualizer and simulator**

This simulator was written as a digital knowledge product for APSC181 Dynamics. 
This Python-based simulation provides a real-time, interactive visualization of airfoil dynamics in a 3D environment. It demonstrates fundamental aerodynamic principles including:

- Lift and drag forces

- Airflow patterns around airfoils

- Effects of angle of attack on aerodynamic performance


The simulation uses OpenGL for 3D rendering and PyGame for window management and user interaction.

**Requirements**

Python 3.6+
PyGame

**Installation**

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed

Install the required dependencies:

*pip install pygame numpy pyopengl*


**Controls**

UP/DOWN: Increase/decrease angle of attack

LEFT/RIGHT: Decrease/increase flow velocity

W/S: Rotate camera up/down

A/D: Rotate camera left/right

Q/E: Zoom out/in
